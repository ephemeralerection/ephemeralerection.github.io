                        <h2>Description</h2>
                        <p>
                        Iranian master of suspense and character portrayal, and one of few directors/writers that are a guarantee of a great film. Winner of Academy Awards, Golden Globe and Golden Bear, among others. Farhadiâ€™s films are nuanced portraits of the cross-cutting relations among classes, genders, and social groups. They are ambivalent explorations of the implications small personal choices can have on the delicate web of individual connections that make up any social network, carefully crafted and beautifully acted.

                                <p>A complex web of emotional and legal issues is being spun around a young man on death row. Akbar murdered his girlfriend when he was 16 years old; now that he's 18, he's being transferred to an adult prison, where he'll wait until his death sentence is carried out. However, no one is sure when that will be, because Akbar's father is required to pay "blood money" to the father of the slain girl, and that complicates the matters further more...</p>

                    <h2>Showers of my radiant bliss be upon you my dears!</h2>
                    <p class="intro-paragraph">
                        Alas, another year has passed, and the incessant pelvic thrusting of time has pummeled at the anuses of our existence a bit more. And by the looks of it, the vaseline has worn off. But the throbbing of our sphincter is only... Oh, look at me driveling without making a proper introduction.
                    </p>
                    <p class="intro-paragraph">
                        Newcomers, don't worry, everything will be explained in a minute, old-timers - I'm sure you are still confused by it all. And even if you are not, coping with my transcendentally brilliant ideas can be an exhausting, albeit mind altering experience. So let us not delve into technicalities, for it is only the second year we are joined in this mental/electronical/experiential intercourse. And just like they used to tell me in the boy scouts "Relax, only the first finger hurts!". 
                    </p>
                    <p class="intro-paragraph">
                        Onto the main idea behind this website. Well, these awards are envisioned as a summary of my previous year - at least arts-wise (pornographic masterpieces and paraphernalia excluded). And for someone who's actively building a repository of fine digital arts, that's a lot of material to sift through. Through many beautiful encounters and people I've met, the collection has grown and, at the same time, I've grown to become less of a cynic and more of a sociopath. Surely a becoming sentiment for a higher being roaming this sordid mortal wasteland. But in all my self-indulgent glorification, I managed to find time to share a lot of beautiful moments with you, and each of those encounters left me being less of an asshole. So, I'm sure each of you will find bits of yourself here as well. And if anything on this site ends up being enjoyable for you, it will make me a very happy, well endowed, demigod.
                    </p>
                    <p class="intro-paragraph">  
                        Now to address you my dear reader - you reading this implies two of things. First, it means you are a sentient agent capable of thought (good for you). Second, either I think of you as someone special in regards to your intellectual capacity, conversational panache and taste, or someone who sent you the link to this boundless trove of geniality does. To all of you, I sincerely hope you will like the content on the site and if you do, I would like you to share it to anyone you deem worthy of appreciating it. But I must implore you not to publicly share this on social networks for this is a personal expression and should stay that way to maintain its meaning.  
                    </p>
                    <p class="intro-paragraph"> 
                        So, let us all enjoy this beautiful occasion, a singularity in time and space when laws of physics and evolution were put into suspense in order to enrich humanity's gene pool, or as I prefer to call it - my birthday. And please, do not ever change, my aberrant and eclectic dears, for there is no solace in the mind-numbing conformist estrangement of conventional societal paradigms.

                        In my opinion, quite possibly the best dramatic work ever written for television. Loosely based on the ten commandments, this monolith of a series is one of those rare works that have the potential for a lifechanging introspection.

You will listen, apart from others, to riff heavy juggernauts like Mastodon and Gojira, masters of transcendentally complex soundscapes Cynic, technical lunatics Animals as Leaders and Dream Theater, and a very successful experimentation with electronica in Ihsahn and Haken.
